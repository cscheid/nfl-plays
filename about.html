      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>This visualization of all NFL passes was created
	using <a href="http://cscheid.github.com/facet">Facet</a>
	by <a href="http://cscheid.net">Carlos Scheidegger</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>About the data</h2>
      <p>There are 200100 passes in this visualization, from the
	2002-2012 seasons (only regular season games are included). This
	comprises every pass attempted, regardless of completion or
	penalty during the play. Currently, each pass has eight
	attributes stored with it: the quarter, the time elapsed, the
	down, how many yards until 1st down (or touchdown), the
	yardline of the play (not the line at which the pass was
	executed), the total yardage of the play, and whether the pass
	was intercepted or completed.
      </p>
      <p>
	The dataset was created by a simple python script that parses
	Brian Burke's dataset posted at his <a href="http://www.advancednflstats.com/2010/04/play-by-play-data.html">Advanced
	NFL Stats</a> blog.
      </p>
      <h2>Why not SVG?</h2>
      <p>
	I don't think I could make a sufficiently responsive
	visualization of 200K datapoints using SVG. If I could, I
	would have certainly used <a href="http://d3js.org">d3</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>It doesn't work!</h2>
      <p>
	Facet uses WebGL, so you'll need a fairly recent video card
	(anything from 2009 vintage on should be ok). You'll also need
	Google Chrome or Safari. There's a minor bug in Firefox which
	prevents it from working there. I could write code to have
	Facet work around it but I have other things to fix, sorry.
