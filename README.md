# A visualization of 10 years of NFL plays

The data comes from Brian Burke's
[blog](http://www.advancednflstats.com). I merged it all into a single
.csv file, available under data/combined.csv.tar.gz.

To generate the file that is used by this webpage, run
scripts/classify_plays.py (first you'll need to unzip
combined.csv.tar.gz). That script is brittle and ugly as sin: you've
been warned.
